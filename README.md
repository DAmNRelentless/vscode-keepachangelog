|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cl-init         | Initiates a new changelog with the header, needed links and a place for your releases and tags.                                                                                              |

## **üîß Installation**
Go to the [Visual Studio Code Marketplate][Marketplace] and click the *install* button on the top of the site. You should be prompted to open [Visual Studio Code] in order to install the extension.

You can also use the integrated extension browser in [VSCode][Visual Studio Code] to install it.


## **‚úã Usage**
By default, snippets will only be available in Markdown files which are called `changelog.md` (case-insensitive).<br>
If you want to change that, you can do this in the extension settings. Keep in mind that only Markdown files are supported though.

This ensures that you only have the changelog snippets in the files you want them so they are not suggested in all Markdown documents.<br>
You can also configure if the snippets should be suggested in unnamed files.

All snippets of this extension are prefixed with `cl-`.<br>
The `c` is a trigger character which means that as soon as you write the `c`, you will get suggestions with snippets from the extension.

If you don't want this, you can disable the trigger character in the extension settings as well.

Furthermore, you can manually trigger the snippet suggestions because they mostly stay hidden in Markdown files as a standard behaviour of [VSCode][Visual Studio Code] itself.<br>
To do that, press CTRL + Spacebar after writing `cl` and you should see the snippets.

This is the default keybind for suggestions. If this doesn't work for you, make sure you check which keybind you have set for `editor.action.triggerSuggest`.

Take a look at the additional settings and configure the extension to your liking.
